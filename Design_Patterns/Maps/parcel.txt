Instead of using ts-node we can use parcel like nodemon
for ts

using npx we can run the Parcel tool

Use type Module in script tag of Index.html 

npx parcel index.html

it will convert index.ts to index.js and run it inside html

go to Maps run npx parcel index.html

Then go to localhost1234

file name with capital letter starting will export some methods to index

we can install whatever packages of javascript we want

but type script needs to know what type of argument they take and what type they will return

In short ts have to know what type of datas are flowing through the applications.

so every js packages their is a Type definition file so type script may know their types

Typescript Code --- Type Definition File --- JS library

some times Type Definition files are automatically downloaded by the JS library 

but some times we need to download the files for the JS library

definitely Typed - means type file for JS library

for script file we had for google in index.html we need to add

Type Definition file also because ts won't know does we have a global variable

google in it.

Ctrl + click - google - to see their methods - Maps - control click

Remember the ctrl + click - interface (don't forget it)
