class Wall                                |---> class Rectangle
 -> color: string                         |      -> height: number
 -> area(): number --|                    |      -> width: number 
 -> dimensions: Shape --------------------|      -> area(): number 
                                          |
 class Window                             |---> class Circle 
  -> open: boolean                                -> radius: number 
  -> toggleOpen(): void                           -> area(): number 
  -> arae(): number 
  -> dimensions: Shape 

  Here if we want wall to be rectangle -> we can use the rectangle class using the 
  -> dimensions and refer its methods -> same goes for window also
