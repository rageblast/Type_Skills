tsc index.ts -> gives -> index.js

ts code - inside - src
js code - inside - build

to do the above follow the below

tsc --init (bash) (or) (tsc.cmd --init) (windows) -> it will create a tsc config file 
- why we use it because we have two folders src -> hosts ts files
- build - hosts js files of the above ts files

use the rootdir and outDir in ts.config to do the above

tsc -w - this will watch the files and whenever ever we change the files it will recreate the js files for us


Type Gaurds:

1. this.collection instanceof Array
2. typeof this.collection === 'string'

Narrow type of a value to a primitive type: 
typeof - number string boolean symbol

Narrow down every other type of value:
instanceof - Every other value that is created with a constructor function

Like - own class(defined by us), array, Date etc
