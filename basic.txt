npm install -g typescript ts-node

tsc --help

vs - view - command palette - install path

prettier - settings

- the above one is used to install typescript
- ts-node is a another package that used to complie typescript easily

- first we need to run 
- tsc index.ts

- then a js script is created for the above command

- then run node index.js

- to combine both we use ts-node index.ts - the ts-node library we installed help's use to run both the node and tsc

tsc --init (bash) (or) (tsc.cmd --init) (windows) -> it will create a tsc config file 
- why we use it because we have two folders src -> hosts ts files
- build - hosts js files of the above ts files

use the rootdir and outDir in ts.config to do the above

tsc -w - this will watch the files and whenever ever we change the files it will recreate the js files for us 

npm install @types/node -> type definition file for all node library
