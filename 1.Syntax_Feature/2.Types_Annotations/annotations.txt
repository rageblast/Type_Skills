how to apply Type Annotations + Type Inference for below ones

- Varaiables
- Functions
- Objects

Type Annotations:

Code we add to tell Typescript what type of value
a variable will refer to 

Type Inference:

Typescript tries to figure out what type of value a
varaiable refers to 

Type Annotations  ----- Type Inference
(We developers tell     (Typescript guesses the type)
Typescript the type)

when to use

Annotations:
- when we declare a var on one line then initialize it later
- when we want a var to have a type that can't be inferred
- when a function returns the 'any' type and we need clarify the value 

Inference:
Always!
