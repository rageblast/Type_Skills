// advance step process

Node executes our code 

Class definition read in - decorators are executed

Decorators associate route configuration info with the method by using metadata

All method decorators run

Class decorator of '@controller' runs last

Class decorator reads metadata from each method, adds complete
route definitions to router

Metadata:

Proposed feature to be added to JS (and thus, TS)

Snippets of info that can be tied to a method, property, or class definition 

Can be used for super custom stuff

Typescript will (optionally) provide type information as metadata 

Read and written using the reflect-metadata package
