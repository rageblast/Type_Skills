1. Use the lib normally, adding in basic type annotations where possible
2. Use a TS adapter library that has helpers for using your lib with TS
3. Twist your lib to work with TS classes

Pros and cons

Cons:

Type definition files alone can't express what is going on in the JS world accurately (example: middleware)

Type definition files provided to us aren't always accurate

Inputs to aserver (or any program with external inputs) are not guaranteed to exist, or be of the correct type


Pros:

  Addressing these type issues with Typescript can force us to write better code



  issue can be solved using 
  1. changing the type definition file(not advisable)
  2. creating interface(advisable)

  some type definition files have good support for ts like cookie session etc

  convert express to use classes and interface and modifier

  Massaging TS and Express to work better together will take a lot of time + effort
