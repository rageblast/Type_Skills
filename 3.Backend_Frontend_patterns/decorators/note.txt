Functions that can be used to modify/change/anything different properties/methods in the class 

Not the same as JS decorators 

Used inside/on classes only

Understanding the order in which decorators are ran are the key to understanding them 

Experimental

Decorators on a property, method, accessor

first argument is the prototype of the object

second argument is the key of the property/method/accessor on the object

Third argument is the property descriptor 

Decorators are applied when the code for this class is ran (not when an instance is created)
